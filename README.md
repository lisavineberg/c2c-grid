An app to store corner-to-corner knitting patterns.

Originally built on create-react-app and FaunaDB; migrated to Next and Supabase.

TODO

- tidy up sign up/login (reuse components, modal?, password validation, style)
- logout
- on submit of grid, show success/fail (reset grid?)
- add stars to original blanket ones
- ability to delete pattern, edit pattern (stop fetching by name?)
- only fetch patterns associated with your account
- hide `storage` button when not logged in?
- general style
